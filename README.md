# GruBot 3.0.0
GruBot is an open-source discord bot to provide basic services to my friends discord server. If I had a reliable host I would provide a link to invite the bot to your own servers, but alas, I do not. 

# Installation
To install GruBot 3.0.0, download the code with the green button on the top that says "code". Extract the file and make sure that you have Python 3.7.2 or above installed. 

# Usage
Linux:
`cd grubot`
`python main.py`
If an error arises, ensure that you have Python 3.7.2 or above installed. If you do, then try
`python3 main.py`

Windows:
`python grubot/main.py`
If an error arises ensure that you have Python 3.7.3 or above installed. If you do, then try
`python3 grubot/main.py`

# Troubleshooting
If you have any issues please refer to the above instruction. If you continue to have issues dont be afraid to raise an issue, and I may be able to help you. 

# Issues
If you have any issues not related to running the code, please do not be afraid to create a pull request, or raise an issue. 

# Updating
I do plan on updating the bot frequently. Please be aware that I am rather busy. I will not be able to update the bot daily, excluding the holiday command. I plan on adding commands for pokemon information, bedwars stats, and (possible) facial recognition commands*.
*This assumes that I have a reliable host, or a more powerful system to run the bot off of. If you have a good enough system, and/or already existing code for it please do not be afraid to create a pull request
